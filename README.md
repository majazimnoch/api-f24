# FlightRadar24 API Fetcher ✈️

This project fetches live flight positions from the FlightRadar24 API and saves the data as a JSON file, later on getting some information from it. It specifically retrieves flights related to **Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ESSA)**.

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches real-time flight data.
- The script uses FileSaver.js to download JSON data.
- There are two js files: one for fetching (script.js), and one for working on the data (results.js).
